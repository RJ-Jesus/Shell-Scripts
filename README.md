# Shell-Scripts

Hosting some of my utility shell scripts. Despite writing them mostly to learn how to, you might still find them useful for example to clean up auxiliary files generated when compiling *.tex documents. Either way, if you want any specific script just let me know and I'll be glad to help.

Place the scripts into ```~/bin/```

## Clean

clean - clean - Cleans all files found from your current directory according to the argument specified.  
Useful for example to clean a directory before indexing and commiting a change while using git. Look at the ```clean``` folder for broader explanations.

## CCD

ccd - custom change directory - Changes directory to specified location.  
Quite useful to ```cd``` onto directories that are very far away from your current working directory (and assuming you don't enjoy writing trails of directory names). Further instruction inside ```ccd``` folder.
