### Completion

For the time being, and since I don't own a Mac, **completion for Mac OSX is probably not working** (I mean probably because I actually haven't tested). Anyway, if you want to get it to work and you know something about ```bash```, take a look inside the Linux OS folder on completion and try to port it to Mac. If you manage to do that please let me know by for example making a pull request or something alike.  
Either way once I can get my hands on a Mac and have some free time I will run some debug and hopefully get a version working.
