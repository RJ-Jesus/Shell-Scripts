# This version of _ccd also works standalone, but may take advantage of Cron usage (if it was configured). Thus, it's preferable.
# Despite working without Cron, it assumes that you are using it (otherwise it's useless to have that first 'if' conditional).
# Instructions for setting the Cron jobs are available at the associated README
