### Using Cron

Since the completion of this script is quite resources demanding I've decided to include a kind of "cached aproach" to this. With this in mind I've used ```cron``` to automate the creation of a file with the full list of available directories. This is still in it's early stages, as I test this funcitonality I'll update the log above.  
As a side note, all files here are related to completion jobs. Thus, the file named ```ccd``` is not actually the script. Only the file with the rules for the completion.
